					<p><span>My self-summary</span><br>
					I am a filmmaker/traveller/opinion leader. Having lived and studied in five continents, I long to become a Renaissance woman in the modern time.</p>

					<p><span>The first thing people usually notice about me</span><br>
					I have a pair of sharp, cunning and curious eyes. My foreign friends would also notice that I have an Americanized accent as a non-native English speaker. </p>

					<p><span>What I'm doing with my life</span><br>
					I'm busy making my dreams come true! The most recent one is to make the world's first exclusive short documentary on Sleep No More, the famous immersive play that gained its reputation in New York. I went to see the show this June and now they're launching a new production in Shanghai, and I just interviewed the director in person – amazing! </p>

					<p><span>The experience that I am the most proud of</span><br>
					I am the first and the only Chinese student in my department at UVa, as well as the first Chinese national to work at the National Museum of Natural History in a creative position. </p>

					<p><span>My childhood hero is</span><br>
					Steve Irwin the "Crocodile Hunter". I have been a big naturalist since I can remember, and Steve is the reason that I wanted to make documentaries. This dream seemed to be extravagant when I was little; but now I have made documentaries in the world's largest natural history museum. </p>

					<p><span>I am really good at</span><br>
					…maneuvering in a new, complex, and/or cross-cultural working environment. A film crew is usually assembled on project base, and I know how to turn a bunch of highly-skilled strangers into a bonded team. As a documentary filmmaker, I'm also good at communicating with people and reaching their hearts.</p>

					<p><span>On a typical Friday night I am</span><br>
					…watching movies in the theater or singing karaoke with my friends. So I'm very excited to hear from the dual degree alums that there's a tradition for all dualies to go to karaoke together once every year. If you also like karaoke, please feel free to join me!</p>

					<p><span>My favorite book/movie/music</span><br>
					My recent favorite book is Creativity. Inc – the secret of how Pixar has become one of the greatest creative companies in the world. The Chinese filmmaking industry tends to focus on the money and the numbers, neglecting the importance of cultural and artistic values. I think Pixar's formula of creativity is something that we should learn from.</p>

					<p><span>The most private thing Im willing to admit</span><br>
					I am a popular blogger on the Chinese social media platforms, with more than twenty thousands of followers and around two million hits. This is my "superman" secret that I don't usually reveal to friends in real life, although I do sometimes get recognized by my followers on the street. <br>
					I write about my life experience to promote idealism and feminism, which I see are two important issues in China.  </p>

					<p><span>You should <a href="mailto:erisqian@gmail.com">message</a> me if</span><br>
					...you'd like to hang out with an open-minded listener, or explore New York City with an experienced traveller. Or if you're looking for a partner to make something cool happen in the fillmmaking biz! </p>
